To run on CMD locate the directory 3p91assign1\CodeForCMD\TrafficGameCode 

and use the command: java GameEnginePack.GameEngine


example: C:\Users\T490\Documents\3p91assign1\CodeForCMD\TrafficGameCode >java GameEnginePack.GameEngine


If this does not work the java version might be a problem, so I have a provided another version of the source code in directory
3p91assign1\TrafficGameCode which can be opened in a compiler and run through the GameEngine Class located in the package "GameEnginePack"
