To run on CMD locate the directory A3\CodeForCMD\TrafficGame\out\production\TrafficGame

then type: java Main 

example: C:\Users\T490\Desktop\A3\CodeForCMD\TrafficGame\out\production\TrafficGame>java Main

If this does not work the java version might be a problem, so I have a provided another version
which can be opened in a Java IDE (INTELLIJ) and run.
